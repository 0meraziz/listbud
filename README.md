## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Custom CSS utilities
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (local)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies (server + client)
npm run install-deps
```

### 2. Start Development

**Option 1: Use the development script (recommended)**
```bash
./dev.sh
```

**Option 2: Start both services with npm**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Option 3: Start individually (if you have terminal issues)**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
npm run server

# Terminal 2: Start client
npm run client
```

**Option 4: Manual start**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start client
cd client && npm start
```

### 3. Access the Application
- **Client**: http://localhost:3000
- **Server**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health

## How to Use

### **Import Places from Google Maps:**
1. Get your Google Takeout data (see section below)
2. Click "Import" button on dashboard
3. Upload your CSV file
4. Places will be automatically organized into a folder named after your CSV file

### **Organize Your Places:**
- **Add Categories**: Use Category Manager to create categories with colors
- **Create Folders**: Use Folder Manager to create organizational folders
- **Assign Categories**: Click the tag icon on any place card to assign categories
- **Move to Folders**: Click the folder icon on any place card to move between folders
- **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar and filter by categories

### **For Testing:**
- Use "Delete All" button to quickly clear all places when testing imports
- Button appears only when places exist and includes confirmation dialog

## Getting Your Google Maps Data

### Step 1: Request Your Data
1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Click "Deselect all" then find and select "Saved"
3. Choose format: CSV
4. Click "Next step" → "Create export"
5. Wait for the download link (can take a few minutes to hours)

### Step 2: Extract and Import
1. Download and extract the archive
2. Navigate to `Takeout/Saved/Saved Places/`
3. Look for CSV files (usually named like "Saved Places.csv")
4. In ListBud, click "Import Places" and upload the CSV file

## Development Notes

### Database
- Uses SQLite for local development
- Database file: `server/database.sqlite`
- Schema auto-creates on first run

### Authentication
- Simple JWT-based authentication
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- 7-day expiration

### Error Handling
- Client shows user-friendly error messages
- Server logs errors to console
- Rate limiting enabled (100 requests/15 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"concurrently: command not found"**
   - Solution: `npm install concurrently`

2. **Tailwind CSS PostCSS errors**
   - **Solution**: Tailwind CSS has been removed to avoid PostCSS conflicts
   - The app uses custom CSS utilities that provide the same styling
   - No additional configuration needed - just start the app normally

3. **Port already in use**
   - Change ports in `server/.env` (PORT=5000)
   - Or kill existing processes

4. **Import fails**
   - Check CSV file format
   - Ensure file is from Google Takeout Maps export
   - Check file size (max 10MB)

5. **Database errors**
   - Delete `server/database.sqlite` to reset
   - Restart server to recreate tables

6. **Authentication issues**
   - Clear browser localStorage
   - Check JWT_SECRET in `server/.env`

### Development Commands

```bash
# Check service status
./status.sh

# Build client for production
npm run build

# Test server endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/health

# View database
sqlite3 server/database.sqlite
```

### Additional Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check logs**: Look at terminal output for specific error messages
2. **Restart services**: Stop and restart both server and client
3. **Clear cache**: Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies
4. **Check ports**: Ensure ports 3000 and 5000 are available

For detailed troubleshooting, see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
