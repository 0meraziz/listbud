# ListBud MVP Setup Guide

## What you've built

A minimal viable product for organizing Google Maps saved places with:
- Simple authentication system
- Google Takeout import functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Basic categorization
- Responsive web interface

## Next steps to run the application

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "/Users/omer.aziz/code/0meraziz/personal gh/listbud"
npm run install-deps
```

### 2. Start the application
```bash
# Option 1: Start both services together
npm run dev

# Option 2: Start manually
./start.sh

# Option 3: Start individually
# Terminal 1:
npm run server

# Terminal 2:
npm run client
```

### 3. Access the application
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- Create an account or login
- Try importing the demo data: `demo-places.json`

## Testing the import functionality

1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click "Import Places"
3. Upload the `demo-places.json` file
4. You should see 5 demo places imported

## Key features to test

1. **Authentication**: Register/login functionality
2. **Import**: Upload Google Takeout JSON files
3. **Search**: Filter places by name or address
4. **Categories**: Create categories and filter by them
5. **CRUD**: Delete places (edit/update coming in future versions)

## Architecture decisions made

### 1. Google Takeout Integration
- Instead of trying to access Google Maps API directly (which doesn't provide saved places)
- Users export their data from Google Takeout
- App parses the JSON format and imports places

### 2. Simple Authentication
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Basic email/password authentication
- No OAuth complexity for MVP

### 3. Local SQLite Database
- Perfect for MVP and local development
- Easy to migrate to PostgreSQL later
- No cloud dependencies

### 4. Minimal UI
- Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Focus on core functionality
- Easy to extend with additional features

## What's working

✅ User registration and login
✅ Google Takeout JSON import
✅ Search and filter functionality
✅ Basic categorization
✅ Responsive design
✅ Place management (view, delete)

## Potential improvements for future versions

1. **Google Maps visualization**
2. **Advanced filtering** (rating, location radius)
3. **Export functionality**
4. **Collaborative lists**
5. **Mobile app**
6. **Cloud deployment**
7. **Category icons and colors**
8. **Bulk operations**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port conflicts**: Change ports in `server/.env`
2. **Database issues**: Delete `server/database.sqlite` to reset
3. **Import failures**: Check JSON file format matches Google Takeout structure
4. **Authentication problems**: Clear browser localStorage

The MVP is ready to use! The foundation is solid and can be extended with additional features as needed.
