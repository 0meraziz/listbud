# Critical Fixes Summary - July 17, 2025 PM

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Add Place Button Not Working
**Problem**: The Add Place modal was not properly submitting form data.
**Solution**:
- Fixed form data handling in `AddPlaceModal.tsx`
- Corrected latitude/longitude data types (string → number conversion)
- Ensured proper API integration with `placesService.createPlace()`

### 2. ✅ CSV Import Auto-Folder Creation
**Problem**: CSV uploads were not automatically organized into folders.
**Solution**:
- Backend already implemented folder creation based on CSV filename
- Import service in `routes/import.ts` creates folders automatically
- Places are assigned to the created folder via `folder_id`

### 3. ✅ Category Assignment Functionality
**Problem**: No UI to assign categories to places.
**Solution**:
- Added category dropdown menu in `PlaceCard.tsx`
- Implemented `handleCategoryChange` in `Dashboard.tsx`
- Connected to existing API endpoints for category management

### 4. ✅ Folder Assignment Functionality
**Problem**: No way to move places between folders.
**Solution**:
- Added folder dropdown menu in `PlaceCard.tsx`
- Implemented `handleFolderChange` in `Dashboard.tsx`
- Connected to existing folder management API endpoints

### 5. ✅ Filter Button Functionality
**Problem**: Search and filter buttons were not working.
**Solution**:
- SearchBar component was already implemented correctly
- Fixed integration with Dashboard's `handleSearch` function
- Category-based filtering now works properly

### 6. ✅ Delete All Places (Testing Feature)
**Problem**: Need ability to quickly clear all places for testing imports.
**Solution**:
- Added `DELETE /api/places` endpoint to delete all user places
- Added `deleteAllPlaces()` method to API service
- Added "Delete All" button to Dashboard with confirmation dialog
- Button only appears when places exist
