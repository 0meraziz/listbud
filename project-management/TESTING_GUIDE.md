# Testing Guide - Folder-Based UI Update

## New Features to Test

### 1. Folder-Based Navigation
- **Expected**: Dashboard shows folders by default, not all places
- **Test**: Open the app - should see folder cards, not place cards
- **Navigation**: Click on a folder to see places inside it
- **Back Navigation**: Use "Back to Folders" button to return to folder view

### 2. Fixed Search Functionality
- **Test in Folder View**: Navigate into a folder, then use search
- **Expected**: Search should only show results from current folder
- **Test Categories**: Click category filter buttons - should filter results
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected categories should be highlighted

### 3. Unorganized Places
- **Expected**: Places without folders appear in "Unorganized" folder
- **Test**: Create a place manually - should appear in Unorganized folder
- **Navigation**: Click Unorganized folder to see places without folders

### 4. Enhanced UI Elements
- **Folder Cards**: Should show folder name, color, and place count
- **Contextual Headers**: Header should show current folder name when in folder view
- **Empty States**: Better messaging when no folders or places exist

## Test Cases

### Import Flow
1. Import CSV file
2. Should create folder based on CSV filename
3. All imported places should be in that folder
4. Dashboard should show the new folder

### Search Flow
1. Navigate into a folder with multiple places
2. Use search bar to find specific places
3. Try category filtering
4. Search should only show results from current folder

### Navigation Flow

## Known Issues Still Being Worked On

- Overall design system needs more polish
- Some components need better spacing and styling

## Success Criteria
