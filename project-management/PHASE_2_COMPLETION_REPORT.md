- Enhanced validation and form handling
- Added proper TypeScript types throughout

## âœ… VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY

### Build Status
- âœ… Client builds successfully with minimal warnings
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… Only minor ESLint warnings remain (non-blocking)

### Component Integration
- âœ… All new UI components properly exported from `ui/index.ts`
- âœ… All major components refactored to use new design system
- âœ… Consistent styling and behavior across components
- âœ… Proper prop passing and event handling

### Code Quality
- âœ… Removed unused imports and cleaned up code
- âœ… Consistent naming conventions
- âœ… Proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode compatibility

## ðŸ”„ PHASE 2 COMPLETION STATUS: 95%

### What's Been Accomplished:
1. **Core Button Component** âœ… - Complete with all variants and states
2. **Input Field Components** âœ… - Complete with validation and icons
3. **Icon System Integration** âœ… - Lucide React integration complete
4. **Basic Layout Components** âœ… - Container, Stack, Card complete
5. **Component Integration** âœ… - All major components updated
6. **Type Safety** âœ… - Enhanced TypeScript integration

### Remaining 5% (Minor Polish):
1. **Loading States Polish** - Some components could benefit from better loading indicators
2. **Error Message Consistency** - Standardize error display patterns
3. **Focus Management** - Improve accessibility focus flow
4. **Animation Consistency** - Ensure consistent transition timing
